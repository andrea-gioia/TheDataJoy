# Semantic Gap

## Post
Semantic Ownership: shift left or right? ðŸ¤” 

ðŸ¤“ In a nutshell, I believe that semantic modeling should lean towards the right, with a dedicated centralized federated modeling team. In contrast, the mapping between data (physical schema and domain-specific semantics) and the centrally defined semantic model (ontology) should lean towards the left, distributed among various teams responsible for the data (data product teams).

ðŸ—“ If you'll be at Big Data LDN next week, I'll present on this topic, delving into more detail. In the following weeks, I'll distill the presentation's content into a dedicated blog post.
