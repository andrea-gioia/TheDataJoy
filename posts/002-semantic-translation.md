# Semantic Translation

## Post

ü§î Data product semantics: one, none, or a hundred thousand?

ü•á The semantics of data is undoubtedly one of the most crucial pieces of metadata that one inevitably has to manage sooner or later. Ultimately, nobody chooses to use a dataset because it adheres to a specific schema or is provided by a particular service. A dataset is utilized in accordance with the business concepts to which it is linked, that is, based on its semantics.

üí• Traditional monolithic data architectures ensure unified data semantics by design. But what about semantics in distributed data architectures like the **datamesh**? Modularization often leads to fragmented semantics, at least one for domains, making life complex for data consumers. 

ü§ì Various approaches exist to tackle this translation problem...

1Ô∏è‚É£ Decentralized semantic translation: 
The task of reconciling different semantics is left to each individual consumer

2Ô∏è‚É£ Centralized semantic translation: 
The task of defining a unified semantic model and reconciling the various semantics used by domains is assigned to a dedicated central team

3Ô∏è‚É£ Federated semantic translation: 
The task of defining a unified semantic model is assigned to a dedicated central team but the task of translating domain semantics into the semantics of the unified model is distributed across data product teams.

Which approach do you usually follow? 1Ô∏è‚É£, 2Ô∏è‚É£, 3Ô∏è‚É£ , or something else?
