❓ What is #conceptualModeling? 🤷‍♂️

🤓 Many organizations gather metadata about the physical data in their systems and organize them in a #dataCatalog. They define a #controlledVocabulary of terms important to the organization (#businessGlossary) and then annotate the physical models with glossary terms to improve information retrieval processes (...often relying on semi-automatic classification procedures 🤖 ).

🛑 The vocabulary cataloged within the business glossary is a useful element for constructing a conceptual model but is not sufficient on its own. A conceptual model is not just a flat collection of terms; it is a structure that associates terms with concepts (classes and properties) and correlates concepts through various types of relationships (predicates). This type of model is usually referred to as an #ontology.

🚩 Conceptual modeling is therefore aimed at producing, more or less formally depending on cases and contexts, a domain ontology that defines the core business concepts.

P.s. I generally use the term #semanticModeling to refer to a type of conceptual modeling that aims not only to map key business concepts through an ontology but to do so in a formal and machine-readable manner, typically using standards defined by the W3C consortium.
