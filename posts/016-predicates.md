# Predicates

## Post

What exactly is a semantic relationship? 🤔

In general, it is a binary relation, also known as a predicate, that connects a subject to an object. Predicates are "the small, human-tractable collection that makes data and knowledge compression happen — they are the components that we combine to create more complex concepts." (M. Dillinger) 

The structure of a predicate determines the expressiveness of the model and its applicability. The main characteristics of a predicate, according to Mike Dillinger, PhD, are:

🏷️ Label/Identifier 
📝 Formal Attributes 
✒️ Signature 
🌐 Grounding 
➡️ Entailments
