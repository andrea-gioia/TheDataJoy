Data product interoperability is not enough, composability is also needed

ðŸŒŠ A **#dataProduct** makes a data asset liquid. The liquidity of a data asset is defined as the ease with which it can be reused and integrated with other data assets. The more reusable and integrable a data asset is, the more liquid it is. The more liquid a data asset is the greater its value ðŸ’µ 

ðŸ§© **#interoperability**, guaranteed through **#dataContracts**, enables ease of reuse. However, an interoperable data product is not necessarily composable. 

ðŸŽ¶ **#composability** occurs when an interoperable data product can be integrated with other data products in different combinations. If a product can be reused but always within the same predetermined configuration, it is interoperable but not composable. 

ðŸ¤“ For example, a puzzle piece is interoperable but not composable because it fits with others only in a specific configuration. A Lego block, on the other hand, is both interoperable and composable.

âœ… For truly composable data products, seamless integration at the semantic level is crucial. This can be achieved by adopting a shared conceptual model, or **#ontology**, that allows data products to connect their managed data assets to a common semantic.
