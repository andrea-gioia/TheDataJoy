# Knowledge Graph

## Post

**#KnowledgeGraphs** (KG) are making waves in the data community, emerging as a trending topic. But what exactly is a KG?

ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è The truth is, there's no clear-cut answer; no universally agreed-upon definition exists.

ü§ì The term KG gained prominence in 2012 thanks to Google and their renowned post, "Things not strings," where they unveiled the incorporation of a KG to supercharge their search engine. Much like an **#ontology**, a KG serves as an information representation system. However, pinning down the precise boundary between an ontology and a KG sparks ongoing debate.

üëâ From my perspective, the most pragmatic distinction lies in the nature of the represented data, not their scale or semantic depth. A KG encompasses both the definition of concepts and relationships between them (ontology) and the instances of various concepts (factual data).

üëâ Consequently, a KG melds conceptual and physical modeling into a seamless, uniform representation. This allows to delegate physical modeling to data product teams (shift left) and to concentrate conceptual modeling on a federated team composed of domain experts (shift right).

P.S. The connections between concepts and instances (semantic links) essentially function as relationships, akin to those found in the ontology between concepts. Therefore, it's plausible to view a KG as a specific type of ontology where, alongside concepts, factual data also resides. Since the reverse isn't necessarily true (not all ontologies are KGs), when I use the term ontology without additional specification, I'm referring solely to the descriptions of concepts and relationships between them (i.e. the conceptual model).
