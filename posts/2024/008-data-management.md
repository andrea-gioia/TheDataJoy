# Data Management

## Post

Data management is not really about managing data 💥

1️⃣ At the most basic level, Data Management is about managing information. Information is data put into context. Metadata gives context to data making it usable 📊🔍

2️⃣ At an intermediate level, Data Management is about managing knowledge. Knowledge is information put into a fit-to-purpose conceptual model. Domain ontologies provide a conceptual model to reason over gathered information making it actionable 🧠💡

3️⃣ At the most sophisticated level, Data Management is about managing intelligence. Intelligence is knowledge turned into actions. Artificial intelligence masks the data and all their superstructures behind data-driven applications that directly support us in achieving our goals 🤖🎯


Here are some corollaries to keep in mind 📝

🔄 there is no data management without metadata management
▶ data and metadata MUST be managed together

🔄 there is no intelligence without knowledge and there is no knowledge without information
▶ Data management MUST deal with information first, then with knowledge, and only at the end with intelligence, not the other way around

🔄 managing information is not the end game
▶ data management MUST also have the ambition to manage knowledge and intelligence
