# Data Vocabulary

## Post
🌐 In data-driven organizations, data is everyone's business. It's crucial, therefore, to reconsider the key terms we use to define the essential capabilities foundational to data management. Terms like "Ingest," "process," and "share" carry a technical weight that lacks inclusivity.

I recently heard Michael Atkin define the core capabilities of data management as "Identify", "Describe", and "Standardize" on the Ruben Sardaryan podcast.

1️⃣ Identify: 🧐 Gathering data should not be done blindly. It is vital to first ascertain which data are crucial to collect and the reasons for it. Whereas ingestion is solely a technical task, the identification of valuable data implicates everyone.

2️⃣ Describe: 📚 Data should not just be mechanically processed. Understanding what the data signify and how to shape them for their eventual application is key. Processing is a technical function, but data modeling is a collective endeavor.

3️⃣ Standardize: 📏 Data sharing is not just about distribution. It's essential to standardize data both syntactically and semantically to assure interoperability. Sharing may be technical, but standardization requires a collective effort.

If we believe in the idea that the language we use can shape the way we think and behave (Sapir–Whorf hypothesis), then this basic vocabulary seems to me more appropriate for the purpose of reducing barriers between business and data teams.

What do you think? 💭🤷‍♂️🤷‍♀️
