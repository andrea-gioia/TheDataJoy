# Semantic modeling

## Post

🤔 Are conceptual modeling and semantic modeling the same thing?

⛔ Not exactly...

A conceptual model explicitly and accurately represents...
1️⃣ concepts of interest 🧠
2️⃣ relationships between the concepts ➡️
3️⃣ axioms that constrain concepts and relationships 📜

🤖👥 A semantic model is a specific type of conceptual model that is not only understandable by humans but also by computer systems.

🌐📚 A semantic model is generally described using the W3C-defined standards for the semantic web
