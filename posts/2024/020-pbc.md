The power of composability 💪

Modern economic theories say an organization's true competitive edge isn't what it does, but how quickly it adapts to change. Reorganizing resources to dynamically develop new capabilities is key.

🧩This means the organization itself needs to be built from composable modules at all levels, ensuring agility in adaptation.

1️⃣ At the technological level, **#microservices** and **#dataProducts** are the modularization units. Their composability within their domain is guaranteed by a shared language (syntactic interoperability). Domains are associated with the business capabilities that the organization has. Microservices and data products can be composed in different configurations, when needed, to support new capabilities.

2️⃣ At the architecture level, packaged business capabilities (PBCs), both applicative (A-PBCs) and data (D-PBCs), are the modularization units. Their composability within their domain is guaranteed by a shared domain ontology (semantic interoperability). A-PBCs and D-PBCs can be composed to create different applications to support existing and new value streams.

3️⃣ At the operational level, the composability of the applications thus created, necessary to support the organization in producing value for its stakeholders and consequently to be competitive on the market, is guaranteed by an enterprise ontology that federates the domain ontologies (business interoperability).

🔵 In short, to thrive in today's unpredictable world, adaptation is king. That requires a **#composableEnterprise**. Forget clunky, monolithic systems that cost a fortune to change. Embrace the power of **#composableThinking** and be ready to conquer the VUCA world! 🚀
