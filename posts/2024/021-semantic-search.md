Modern data catalogs are founded on things, not strings üí• 

While data catalogs are crucial for showcasing valuable assets, simply listing them isn't enough. Humans, after all, search for things, not just strings. We use search functions to identify resources that help us solve specific problems. In the context of data products, users aim to find the ones exposing the right data assets to address their unique challenges.

This search process is guided by an individual's mental model of the problem, influencing their search terms and behavior. To truly understand their intent, data catalogs need to go beyond keyword matching. They need to bridge the gap between the user's problem model and the underlying data domain using semantic understanding.

Here's what a modern data catalog should prioritize:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Building ontologies (structured representations of knowledge) instead of simple glossaries, allowing for deeper comprehension of data relationships.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Leveraging semantic search techniques that grasp the inherent meaning of data, not just keywords, leading to more relevant results.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Adopting conversational search interfaces that engage in a dialogue with users, understanding their needs and guiding them towards the perfect data product.

By embracing these advancements, data catalogs can transform from static lists to powerful discovery engines, empowering users to find the data they need, faster and more intuitively.
