# Catalog of catalogs

## Post

💥 Data catalogs are everywhere! 

😀 Every cloud provider or SaaS platform has its own catalog. Collecting high-quality, real-time technical metadata is no longer a problem. 

😫 However, the proliferation of built-in catalogs also leads to fragmentation of the available metadata. An enterprise catalog is needed to rule them all. In this sense, the catalog of catalogs pattern is extremely interesting 🌟✨

The central catalog (🌟) selects the metadata of interest collected from the built-in catalogs (✨) of the various technologies and organizes them into a conceptual model that facilitates their understanding and search. 

✨ The built-in catalogs used by data engineers and platform engineers are specialized in the acquisition of technical metadata. 

🌟 The enterprise catalog used by business experts and information architects specializes in acquiring relevant metadata from built-in catalogs and structuring them into an information architecture that facilitates their understanding and use.

📍 The central catalog must be extremely flexible in mapping each type of metadata and recombining the metadata to produce different models. The central catalog is therefore naturally based on a **#knowledgeGraph**.
