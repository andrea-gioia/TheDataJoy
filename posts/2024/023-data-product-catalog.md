# Data Product Catalog

## Post

Enterprise data catalog must be centered around hashtag#dataProducts 💥 

😵 Having data catalogs without the concept of a data product to group metadata into logical search and consumption units that have meaning for the user is like having a bill of materials management tool without the concept of a product built-in. Users refer to the components to specify the characteristics of the products they are looking for. However, the tool can only return as a result the components that match the search criteria, not the products that contain those components 🙁 

👍 Having technical catalogs capable of collecting, validating, and monitoring metadata is fundamental. 

✋ However, on top of these catalogs, it is also necessary to have an enterprise catalog capable of selecting the relevant collected metadata, grouping it around the concept of a data product, and linking it to the conceptual model used to interpret the user's needs. 

📌 Having a data product catalog at the enterprise level in a catalog of catalogs architecture is a must!
