# Data Product Catalog as a platform

## Post

üí• A Data Product Catalog is not just another product

Unlike traditional data catalogs, a data product catalog is not a product but a mobilization platform.

Its primary purpose is not to support a linear value chain from data producers to consumers. 
Its primary purpose is to support the entire ecosystem of data stakeholders in the organization to create value together.

This goal is achieved in two main ways:

1Ô∏è‚É£ By providing channels and contexts that facilitate interactions and exchanges between ecosystem members (transaction engine)

2Ô∏è‚É£ By providing services and contexts that facilitate learning and improvement for ecosystem members (learning engine)

Therefore, when choosing a data product catalog, you should ask yourself two questions:

1Ô∏è‚É£ What services does it offer to reduce the costs of ideation, development, operational management, and use of data products?

2Ô∏è‚É£ What tools does it offer to promote the incremental growth of a data-driven culture?
