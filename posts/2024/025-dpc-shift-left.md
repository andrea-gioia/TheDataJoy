# Shiftig left metadata management

## Post

🤓 A data product catalog does not need to automatically harvest technical metadata. 

📘 Traditional metadata catalogs generally compete on the number of connectors to different storage systems to automatically read the metadata of interest. Often, the licensing model itself is tied to the number and frequency of sources and assets that are scanned.

📙 A data product catalog, on the other hand, expects to receive curated metadata directly from the data product dev team in the form of a descriptor file. The data product catalog uses the descriptor to validate that the product is compliant with global governance policies. Only if it is compliant does it then orchestrate the deployment of the data product.

🔍 In this scenario, the lifecycle and responsibility for metadata are aligned with the lifecycle and responsibility for data. The data product catalog acts as a quality gateway, ensuring that the products in production are all and only those that are accompanied by the appropriate metadata and compliant with global policies.

💙 A data product catalog thrives in a world where data governance has been shifted left.
