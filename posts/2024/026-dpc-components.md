# Data Product Catalog Components

ü§î What is a Data Product Catalog?

‚è© A data product catalog is a platform whose primary objective is to help the ecosystem of data producers and consumers extract value from data.

‚è∫ The core component of a data product catalog is the metadata catalog. This component manages all technical and semantic metadata. All registered metadata is organized around the concept of a **#dataProduct**, which is the unit of modularization of the data management solution.

üîÅ Anyway, to support the data ecosystem, a data product catalog does not simply collect metadata but also manages their activation. 
To this end, there are two other fundamental components:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Developer Platform: The DDP facilitates the production and operational management processes of data products (i.e., develop, publish, validate, deploy, monitor, evolve, and decommission)

2Ô∏è‚É£ Enterprise Data Marketplace: The EDM facilitates the consumption processes of data products (i.e., search, understand, evaluate, access, compose, share)

üß© These three platform components (Metadata Catalog, DDP, and EDM) do not necessarily have to be a single product. They can be different products but must be tightly integrated to enable within the data ecosystem the **#platformPlays** listed in the figure. 

üï∏ Only in this way is it possible to move from value production processes based on a linear data value chain (economy of scale) to value production processes based on a data value network (economy of scope).

‚ö† P.S. I don't want to invent a new name for this platform, but none of the existing names identify well the type of mobilization platform I have in mind. The names that come closest are probably "data mesh self-service platform" and "data fabric" but they are too tied to specific approaches. However, I would like to discuss more about the platform, its components, and its capabilities than about its name.
