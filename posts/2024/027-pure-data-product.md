# Pure Data Products

## Post

A data product catalog supports both the development (data developer platform) and the consumption (enterprise data marketplace) of data products... but what is a data product? 🤔 

Every digital application uses data. However, not all applications built using product management principles can be considered data products.

👎 For example, transactional applications typically use data only to support their functionalities. Data is just a by-product. We cannot consider such applications to be data products, right?

👍 A digital product can be considered a **#dataProduct** if the data drives the development of its functionalities and is not limited to supporting them.

✌ Data products can be divided into two macro-categories: pure data products and analytical applications. 

1️⃣ Pure data products expose data with the aim of making it easily usable to support different use cases. 
2️⃣ Analytical applications (e.g., reports), on the other hand, expose functionalities (e.g., visualizations) aimed at supporting specific use cases.

While analytical applications unlock the value hidden within data for specific users, the underlying pure data products empower the scalability and long-term viability of the entire data ecosystem.

🎯 An ideal data product catalog should manage all types of data products. However, within a platform context, the main objective of a data product catalog should be to favor the development of reusable pure data products, preventing each analytical application from being developed in a siloed manner. 

📌 In essence, a data product catalog should encourage a virtuous cycle within the data ecosystem, promoting a data value chain based on a compose-to-order approach (pure data product) rather than on an engineer-to-order approach (siloed analytical applications).
