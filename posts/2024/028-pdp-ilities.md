The four ilities of a good Pure Data Product...

üìï A data product is a standalone software application whose functionalities are directly driven by the data it manages. A pure data product (PDP) is a type of data product whose functionalities directly expose data in its pure form. 

üéØ The purpose of a PDP is to identify, maintain, share, and multiply the potential value of a data asset.

‚≠ï To identify and maintain the value of a data asset, a PDP must ensure:

1Ô∏è‚É£ data RELEVANCE - because data value is perishable and more data does not necessarily mean more value

2Ô∏è‚É£ data ACCURACY - because data value increases with its quality

‚≠ï To share and amplify the value of a data asset, a PDP must ensure:

3Ô∏è‚É£ data REUSABILITY - because data is not depletable and its value increases with the use

4Ô∏è‚É£ data COMPOSABILITY - because data value increases when combined with other data

These four 'ilities' are closely related to the value of data, managed as a particular type of asset. Other popular 'ilities' can easily be traced back to these four foundational ones. What do you think?
