# Data assets

## Post

🤔 Pure data products are software applications that make a data asset easily reusable, thus increasing its potential value. But what is an asset and is data a real asset?

📚 Accounting theory defines an asset as a resource controlled by the company, stemming from past events, and expected to generate future economic benefits.

💰 An asset's value can be derived from its use (value in use) or its potential sale (value in exchange).

✅ Data undoubtedly qualifies as an asset. Owned by the organization, it can generate value by enabling the delivery of new services, facilitating better decision-making, optimizing performance, and mitigating operational risks.

👉 The key lies in managing data assets as products that can be easily reused to support multiple use cases over time. Since data is not a depletable asset, the initial investment of developing a data product rather than a siloed data solution pays off over time as the number of supported use cases grows. 

👍 In this context, a data product catalog can function as a mobilization platform, streamlining the process for all stakeholders within the data ecosystem. This platform empowers them to realize use cases by building reusable data products instead of resorting to siloed and ad-hoc integration solutions.

💫 By leveraging pure data products and a data product catalog, organizations can unlock the true potential of their data assets and maximize their return on investment made in data management.
