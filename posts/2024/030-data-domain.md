# Data Domains 🏆🥈

## Post

🤔 **#DataProducts** and their ownership should be divided by domain. But what exactly is a domain and what is the best way to identify one?

📖 In Domain-Driven Design (DDD), a domain is a well-defined area of the problem space with its own specialized language, internal rules, and unique behaviors.

Within a company, we can identify domains based on either the organizational structure (business domains) or the information structure (data domains). 

1️⃣ Business domains map one-to-one with organizational units like marketing, sales EMEA, sales Nordics, etc. 

2️⃣ Data domains, on the other hand, center around business objects crucial to the company's value chain, such as customer, product, order, etc.

🤓 Dividing data products and ownership by business domain is a recommended approach. This leverages the existing organizational structure, simplifying responsibility assignment, development budget management, and subject matter expert identification.

✋ In order to be semantically interoperable between different business domains, the data products developed in this way must reference a shared conceptual model (enterprise ontology).

🕸 A federated modeling team composed of representatives from each business domain can manage the definition of this ontology iteratively. This team can further organize by dividing responsibilities based on data domains. Subgroups specializing in specific business objects can be beneficial.

✍ Unlike data product development, which relies on established structures, the modeling team needs to be formed on top of the existing organization. This is a crucial step to avoid data silos and ensure smooth interaction between business domains. 

👉 What do you think? How do you implement the domain-driven data ownership principle?
