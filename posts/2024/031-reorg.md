🤔 How can we keep **#dataProducts** ownership aligned with an ever changing organizational structure?

👉 Data product ownership should be aligned with business domains. 

🤓 A business domain is typically associated with a business capability instance, which is an organizational structure made up of people, processes, and technologies that implements a capability needed by the business to execute its value streams.

✋ However, the capabilities required by a company change over time. Even more frequently, its organizational structure changes and, consequently, how it implements the necessary capabilities. 

✍ When a reorganization occurs, corporate resources (people, processes, and technologies) are redistributed among new and old capabilities instances. Data products and their ownerships must therefore also be redistributed among the capabilities instances in a consistent manner to reflect their purpose in the new organizational model.

👂 How do you manage your data product portfolio to keep it aligned with changes in organizational structure? What are the main challenges in your experience?
