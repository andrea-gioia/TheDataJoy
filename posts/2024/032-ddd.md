# Domain Driven Design

🤔 Why a data engineer should know DDD? 

A hashtag#dataProduct is essentially a software application that provides access to data or data-driven functionalities, developed following the principles of product management.

📘 Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is a software development approach that emphasizes creating a model of the domain (problem space) for which the product is being built (solution space) through language shared among all stakeholders (ubiquitous language).

🤓 As Alberto Brandolini says, "software development is a learning process; working code is a side effect". You must understand the problem to solve it. This understanding comes in DDD from collaboratively building a shared and comprehensible model of the problem with all stakeholders. Each problem has its own model, described in terms of the language used within the domain. In other words, DDD does not rely on a single corporate-level model but rather on many models associated with specific sub-domains and their unique problems and languages.

🔁 DDD is clearly orthogonal to traditional data management methods whose goal is to define a single source of truth but marries well with an approach based on managing data as products. 

✋ However, it should not be confused with the principle of distributing data ownership to domains. This principle and the DDD approach can be used synergistically but are not the same thing. In other words, it is not enough to move ownership to domains to do DDD.

👉 If data products are software applications, data engineers are in fact a family of software engineers. But how widespread is DDD knowledge among data engineers today?
