# Ubiquitous Language

## Post

ðŸ’¬ Applications and data products must speak the same language, the language of the business.

ðŸ’¬ ðŸ—¯ ðŸ’­ Unfortunately, there is no single language spoken throughout the entire organization. Each functional area has its own dialect, which often varies even between sub-units.

ðŸ“˜ In Domain-Driven Design (DDD), a bounded context defines a portion of the business where a common language is spoken, with no ambiguity in terms. Problems are defined at the subdomain level (i.e. business capability). Solutions are instead modeled and developed within bounded contexts (i.e. business capability instances). In this way, it is possible to use a common language to build a solution model shared, and understandable by all stakeholders.

ðŸ‘‰ All solutions developed within the same bounded context should use the same language, whether they are transactional applications or data products. This **ubiquitousLanguage** is the language spoken by the business within the function or specific organizational unit for which the solution is being built. It is of fundamental importance to formalize this language by means of a vocabulary, a taxonomy, or a subdomain ontology.

ðŸ¤” In DDD, ubiquitous language is a central concept. However, I have not found much material produced by the DDD community on how to formalize it. Have I missed something? Any suggestions on this?
