# Context Mapping

## Post

ðŸ‘‡ DDD, context mapping, and enterprise ontologies

ðŸ‘‰ Each data product is built independently, using the common language (ubiquitous language) specific to its bounded context. 

âœ‹ However, business domains, and their associated bounded contexts and products, aren't isolated entities. They actively interact to deliver value streams critical to the organization.

ðŸ’£ As a result, when adopting a data product-centric approach, integrating products from different domains and bounded contexts becomes inevitable. This presents a challenge because data products from different bounded contexts use distinct ubiquitous languages. 

ðŸ“˜ Defining how bounded contexts and their products interact falls under the strategic design phase of Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and is known as context mapping. DDD outlines several patterns for defining interaction between products from different bounded contexts. 

ðŸ”½ The following image highlights the six most relevant context mapping patterns, declining them specifically for data products.
