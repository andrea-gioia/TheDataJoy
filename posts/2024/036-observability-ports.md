🤔 Observability Ports: Why They Matter and Who's Accountable?

👉 Observability ports allow controlled access to the internal state of a data product while preserving the information hiding and encapsulation principles on which its design is based.

🤓 The information about the internal state exposed by a data product is generally called observations or signals.

👨‍⚖️ 👩‍⚖️ The governance team defines the type and semantics of the signals that each data product must produce. It also defines the APIs of the observability ports through which the generated signals are exposed to external observers.

👷‍♂️ 👷‍♀️ The platform team defines the format of the managed signals and the protocol for serializing and sharing them. Based on this protocol, it also provides development teams with a sidecar that collects the signals generated by the data product and makes them available through observability ports that conform to the APIs defined by the governance team.

👨‍🔧 👩‍🔧 Finally, the product team instruments the internal product components with appropriate sensors capable of generating the signals required by governance policies and communicates them to the sidecar provided by the platform team to expose them externally.

🤚 Multiple external tools can therefore use the information exposed by the observability ports to manage the operation of a data product instantiated in a runtime environment. To facilitate interoperability with existing external tools, it is recommended to adopt the Open Telemetry Protocol (OTLP) as the signal management protocol.
