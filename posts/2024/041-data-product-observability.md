# Data Product Observability

## Post

🕵‍♂️ 🕵‍♀️ Leveraging data product observability to manage operations and build trust...

👉 The correct functioning of a data product can be monitored through its observability ports. These ports allow controlled access to the internal state of the data product, ensuring that the principles of information hiding and encapsulation at the core of its design are respected.

🤓 The information about the internal state exposed by a data product is commonly referred to as observations or signals. These signals can take various forms, with the most common being logs, traces, and metrics.

👇 For effective operational management of the data product, it is important to monitor:

1️⃣ Operational Costs (LOGS): A breakdown of generated operational costs (e.g., costs per consumer, costs per processed data asset, etc.)
2️⃣ Activity Events (TRACES): Information on performed activities (e.g., when was the data last updated?)
3️⃣ Lifecycle Events (LOGS): Information on lifecycle transitions (e.g., when the data product was created, published, validated, deployed, etc.)

👇 For establishing trust in the reliability of the data product, it is important to monitor:

1️⃣ Data Quality Indicators (METRICS): Results of quality checks (e.g., missing values, incorrect values, duplicate values, outdated values, etc.).
2️⃣ Audit Trails (LOGS): Information on actions performed (e.g., who, when, how, and why a query was made on the exposed data).
3️⃣ Service Level Indicators (METRICS): Operational performance metrics (e.g., latency, traffic, errors, and saturation).

🤔 What else do you monitor?
