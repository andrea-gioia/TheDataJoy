# Semiotic Triangle

## Post

😧 Data alone has no meaning and, consequently, no value

🤔 Pretty obvious, right? But where does the meaning of data actually come from?

👎 As the semiotic triangle shows us, the meaning of data ( 👉 signifier ) doesn’t come directly from their connection to the specific business process instance that generated them in the first place ( 👉 signified ).

👍 Instead, the meaning of data arises from the conceptualization of the business process that generated them( 👉knowledge ) that each person develops through experience, learning, or reasoning ( 👉 cognitive capabilities ). Without knowledge, symbols, words, or data would lack meaning because we wouldn't have the framework to understand or interpret them.

🎯 For this reason, since data can only be useful and generate value when its meaning is understood, it is essential to treat knowledge as a first-class citizen in our information architectures. 

🤖 This is especially important today, in a world where GenAI models, capable of manipulating language without understanding its meaning like stochastic parrots, absolutely need to be complemented with domain knowledge to realize their full potential.

🗓 I will discuss this further in the talk I’m giving with Jacopo Aliprandi in less than a month at Big Data LDN and in some of my upcoming posts. I hope to see you there, or here 😀
