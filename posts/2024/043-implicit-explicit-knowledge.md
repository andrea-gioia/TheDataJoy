# Implicit and Explicit KNowledge

ðŸ’« Making implicit knowledge explicit...

ðŸ§  Every person represents knowledge through their own mental model. Creating a shared formal model to represent domain-specific knowledge is a deliberate, purposeful, and labor-intensive process that cannot be fully automated.

ðŸŽ¯ However, in the information age, as Drucker observed, knowledge has become the most crucial or 'strategic' factor of production. To gain a competitive edge, organizations must focus on how they produce, acquire, manage, retain, and apply knowledge.

ðŸ‘‰ Therefore, it is essential to develop a holistic knowledge strategy that not only addresses technology but also focuses on processes. Knowledge in fact is dynamic and embedded within networks of actors; thus, it is more effective to view it not as a resource to be accumulated, but as a process to be managed.
