# Ontology Types

## Post

ðŸ¤“ There are several ways to represent implicit knowledge in an explicit model.

ðŸ§  Explicit knowledge models are artifacts that can be used by humans and machines to remember, reason, and create better than they could by using raw data alone.

ðŸ•¸ðŸ’ª Within these models, knowledge is represented through concepts that are connected to each other by relationships or predicates, forming facts or triples. The type of relationship used to link concepts determines the expressive power of the knowledge model and, consequently, its applicability.

ðŸ‘‰ Ontologies are the most expressive model for knowledge representation, as they impose no limits on the types of relationships allowed between concepts. Other less expressive but very popular models include name authority, taxonomy, and thesaurus. In general, an ontology can encompass these simpler models within itself.
