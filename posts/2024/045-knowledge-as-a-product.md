# Knowledge as a Product

💫 Managing knowledge as a product

✋ An enterprise ontology is a system for representing and sharing knowledge within an organization. It is not just a theoretical exercise; it should be a tool used extensively across all business processes to bring value to the organization.

👉 An enterprise ontology should, therefore, be developed and continuously evolved over time as a product, or better yet, as a collection of interconnected products.

👇 Each ontology within the enterprise ontology is thus a product that:
1️⃣ has users with needs to which it brings value
2️⃣ has clear goals related to how it delivers value to its users, based on which development activities are prioritized and results evaluated
3️⃣ has a product owner and a dedicated cross-functional modeling team
4️⃣ has a lifecycle in which the release of the first version is only the first step

🛑 Therefore, it makes little sense to start defining an ontology without clear business objectives and an operational model for managing its development, evolution, and use.
