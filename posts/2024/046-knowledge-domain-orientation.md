💫 Knowledge Domain Ownership

🤓 Knowledge should be managed as a product, or better, as a collection of products. Each knowledge product should have a product owner and an associated modeling team.

🔴 🔵 Knowledge domains, which bring together the development teams for knowledge products, are distinct from business domains, which group the teams developing data products. While business domains (🔴) are structured around the existing organizational chart of the company, knowledge domains (🔵) are defined more deliberately around key data entities or business processes, that naturally span across business domains.

🕸 The structure of knowledge domains (knowledge plane) is thus independent and orthogonal to the structure of business domains (data plane).

👉 Instead of creating entirely new dedicated modeling teams to manage knowledge products, it is generally advisable to establish federated teams. In these teams, each business domain involved with a specific business entity or process under modeling has its own representative. 

🤝 Since knowledge modeling requires consensus among stakeholders to define a shared model, building these models (knowledge products) collaboratively from the ground up rather than imposing them from the top down is preferable. 

🤔 What do you think? How do you organize knowledge management operationally within your organizations? I'm curious 😀
