# Negative externalities

## Post

💰 Modeling knowledge has a cost, but how much does it cost not to do it?

🕵‍♂️ 🕵‍♀️ In the analysis phase preceding the development or evolution of a data product, the data product owner and their team gather all the relevant information necessary for development from all involved stakeholders. 

🧠 Using the collected information then each member of the data product team forms a personal mental model of the problem and the desired solution. Based on these models, they implement the data product. 

🤫 The knowledge models built to create the solution remain implicit and are not merged in a shared explicit knowledge model because doing so would be too costly.

🤔 When the data product begins to be used, consumers need to understand the meaning of the exposed data, not just its syntactic structure. In the absence of an explicit knowledge model that describes the concepts instantiated by the data, consumers have no alternative but to guess or ask the product development team. Both options lead to increasing costs as the number of data product consumers grows.

👉 In summary, not making the knowledge model explicit, when all the information needed to do so is available during the development phase, saves time and costs. However, it also generates negative externalities that are then redistributed to all potential consumers. For widely used data products, the costs generated by these negative externalities often exceed the savings made during development.

⚡ The problem is that while the extra costs during development related to knowledge modeling are visible and concentrated within the domain that owns the product, the costs generated by the negative externalities derived from the lack of knowledge modeling are not visible and are distributed across all the domains that use the data product.
