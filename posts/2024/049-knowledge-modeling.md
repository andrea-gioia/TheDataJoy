‚≠ê A Value-Driven Approach to Modeling Across Data and Knowledge Planes

‚è´ ‚è© The modeling of data exposed by data products and the knowledge captured in the domain ontology occurs on orthogonal planes. Data from data products is modeled locally within business domains, aligning vertically with the organizational structure. In contrast, knowledge within the domain ontology is modeled transversally across business domains, aligning horizontally with the organizational structure.

üîÅ However, it's crucial that these two modeling activities proceed synergistically, following a value-driven approach. Each modeling initiative should be driven by a clear business case. Once the business case is identified, the modeling of the data exposed by the data products necessary to support the business case must be conducted jointly with the modeling of the concepts within the domain ontology required to ensure the semantic interoperability of the former with other already developed data products.

ü§ù The federated modeling team acts as an enabling team, facilitating the work of stream-aligned data product teams. Conceptual modeling should neither precede data product development (a top-down approach) nor follow it (a traditional stewardship approach) but should occur simultaneously. 

üíû With each iteration of this value-driven modeling process, the portfolio of developed data products and the richness of the shared conceptual model expand. This increases the likelihood that new business cases can be implemented by recomposing existing data products and reusing concepts already present in the domain ontology (compose-to-order approach). This is the "AHA moment" when one plus one starts to become greater than two.
