# Incremental Modeling

## Post

💫 Great things are not done by impulse but by a series of small things brought together.

💰 A value-driven approach, where the development of data products and the domain ontology is prioritized based on use cases and carried out synergistically, enables the incremental construction of the Information Architecture (AI)

👇 This approach offers several advantages:

1️⃣ Greater scalability compared to an engineer-to-order approach, which, by not defining the information architecture, does not encourage the reuse of already developed components and generates negative externalities.

2️⃣ Quicker delivery of value to stakeholders and reduced risk compared to a stock-to-order approach, where use cases are implemented only after the entire information architecture is completed.

👉 Building a robust IA architecture is a complex endeavor but also an essential one, especially today because of AI. As with any other complex task, the best way to approach it is to break it down into smaller, manageable parts and address them incrementally (divide and conquer).
