# Ontology as Source of Facts

## Post
✨ An enterprise ontology is a source of facts, not a source of truth!

🤓 The facts in an ontology are expressed through simple sentences composed of a subject, predicate, and object, also known as triples (e.g., a tree is a plant). These triples can be represented as graphs, where the subject and object are the nodes, and the predicate is the edge connecting them.

🧠 👀 The truth of a fact is subjective and depends on the context. Specifically, it depends on the mental model that each person constructs based on their personal experience. The same fact can vary in truth and relevance depending on the specific business subdomains.

👉 For this reason, the ontologies of different business subdomains are different. Each subdomain has a different experience of the same corporate reality. Domain ontology serves as a bridge between subdomain ontologies, providing a minimal base of shared understanding upon which the specific subdomain ontologies can then be built by extension.

🤝 Building a domain ontology is not just about representation (the means) but about reaching an agreement among people (the end). It involves identifying the minimal set of facts on which all parties involved in its definition can agree, even if this requires a compromise, in order to facilitate mutual collaboration.

🤜 🤛 Of course, the construction of a domain ontology also allows for the clear visualization of the points on which it is not possible to reach an agreement between the parties, but even this is valuable knowledge that can later be incorporated into the linked individual subdomain ontologies.
