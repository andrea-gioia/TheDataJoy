# Knowledge Mesh

## Post
💥 The knowledge mesh is a decentralized sociotechnical paradigm based on the same founding principles as the data mesh that provides a new approach to identifying, collecting, representing, and sharing knowledge at scale.

👉 Managing knowledge in a distributed and complex environment can be based on the same principles popularized by data mesh.

👇 In previous posts, linked in the comments, I've discussed how knowledge should be managed as a product, with ownership aligned to knowledge domains.

👨‍🍳 👩‍🍳 'Product Thinking' and 'Domain Ownership' in data mesh are the two principles at the core of developing the organizational architecture. 
🥄 🔪 The principles of 'Computational Governance' and 'Self-Serve Domain-Agnostic Platform' are instead the foundation for developing the technological architecture. 

🔁 These four principles are strongly connected because the problem being addressed—data management for data mesh and knowledge management for knowledge mesh—is a sociotechnical problem. It cannot be solved by focusing solely on either the organizational or technological aspects. The organizational and technological architectures must co-evolve synergistically.

⏩ In the upcoming posts, I will delve deeper into the role of the self-service platform and computational policies within the knowledge mesh paradigm.
