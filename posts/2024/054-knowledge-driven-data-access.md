# Knowledge Driven Data Access

## Post

🧠 Knowledge-driven data access means accessing data through an ontology used to represent its meaning at a conceptual level.

🔎 Connecting an enterprise ontology to data that instantiate its concepts is equivalent to building a virtual knowledge graph. A knowledge graph is a semantic layer that allows for searching first for the data (search for things) and only then into the data (search for strings). 

🤖 🧑 This type of semantic search simplifies life both for business users, who can access data in a way that aligns with their mental model of the processes that generated the data, and for intelligent agents, who need the right context to operate in unfamiliar domains.

👇 To leverage an enterprise ontology for accessing data, it is first necessary to connect it to the data. For this purpose, it is possible e to use: 

1️⃣ ontologies such as hashtag#DPROD as a basis to represent all metadata related to the developed data products

2️⃣ ontologies such as hashtag#R2RML or, more generally, hashtag#RML, to create mappings between the data product schemas, the concepts of the enterprise ontology, and the physical structures in which the data are stored.
