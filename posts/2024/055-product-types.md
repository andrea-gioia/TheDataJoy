# Product Types

## Post
👉 A data product is a product that facilitates an end goal through the use of data.

📕 This is how DJ Patil defines a data product in his book "Data Jujitsu: The Art of Turning Data into Product."

🤔 While it’s a definition that makes sense, it feels rather broad—perhaps too broad to be genuinely actionable. After all, nearly every software application leverages data to deliver its functionalities. So, what truly sets a data product apart?

👇 In a recent blog post (link in the comments), I shared my perspective on what I mean when I talk about data products. 

❓ Does it resonate with you? How have you defined the concept of a data product within your organization?
