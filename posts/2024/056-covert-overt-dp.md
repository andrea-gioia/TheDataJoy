# Covert and Overt Data Products

👉 The Data Product Dichotomy

👇 Data products can be divided into two categories: 

1️⃣ Pure Data Products, aimed at facilitating access to the data they manage, 

2️⃣ Analytical Data Products, designed to deliver functionality based on the data they handle.

🤓 In a pure data product, the more visible and easier the data is to consume (overt data), the higher the product's value. In an analytical application, the opposite is true: the less visible the data (covert data), the more valuable the product becomes. 

🤔 Here’s the catch: the end user rarely needs the data. What they need are decisions supported by the data. So why does it still make sense to consider products where data is overt, like pure data products, as valuable? Can't we focus solely on products where data is covert, like analytical data products?

😉 My answer is in the comments…
