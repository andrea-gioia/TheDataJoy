# Copose to Order

## Post

🚮 In data management, creating excess "stock" is simply wasteful.

👍 This holds true even when adopting a modular approach centered on managing data as a product. Too often, I see organizations measuring the success of their data initiatives by the sheer number of data products they’ve developed, regardless of whether they truly support meaningful use cases.

🛑 Having data products that serve no use case is pointless. Likewise, products that mostly support just one use case are not much better—it’s a clear sign that the integration effort isn’t being reused effectively.

👇 The focus should instead be on a value-driven approach:
1️⃣ Develop data products only when there’s a clear business case for them
2️⃣ Design data products to be flexible enough to support both immediate and future use cases

 This value-driven approach is the only way to gradually build composable data architectures where one plus one is greater than two.
