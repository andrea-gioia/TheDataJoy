**🏃‍♂️‍➡️ Escaping the Data Management Catch-22 🏃‍➡️**

😵‍💫 Enterprise-level data management solutions are complex socio-technical systems. Part of this complexity is essential, meaning it is inherently tied to the functionality the system is designed to deliver and cannot be reduced without compromising its purpose.

📈 In data management, the **essential complexity** is exceptionally high. The value of data assets grows as they become more interconnected, but these very interconnections create complexity. This complexity increases quadratically with the number of data assets managed. As a result, the more value the solution generates, the more complex it becomes—eventually exceeding the cognitive capacity of the team developing it and causing the system to collapse.

👇 This leads to a **Catch-22 paradox**... 
🔴 "The more successful an enterprise-level data management solution is, the more likely it is to fail."

🤔 Is it possible to escape this paradox? The answer is yes. The key lies in addressing the portion of the system's complexity that is **not essential but accidental—complexity** that arises from the development approach itself and can be reduced.

🤓 How can this be done? Fortunately, the solution is well-established in all engineering disciplines that deal with complex systems: when a problem is too complex to solve with a single monolithic solution, it should be broken into smaller, autonomous parts. In other words, the power of modularity must be leveraged.

❤️ In data management, this means treating data as products and building data management solutions as a composition of interconnected data products.
