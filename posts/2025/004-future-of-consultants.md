**🤔  Is AI about to KILL the CONSULTING stars?**

🔮 It’s difficult to predict, but in my view, consulting won’t disappear—at least not in the medium term. However, the role of consultants will evolve. Rather than delivering prepackaged solutions, their focus will shift toward creating the right environment for making the best decisions, supported increasingly by generative AI and intelligent agents.

⁉️ A consultant’s value will lie more in their ability to ask the right questions than in simply providing answers. They must embrace maieutics as a key approach to gaining a deeper understanding of contexts, identifying problems and priorities, and guiding teams toward shared solutions.

😉 We should prepare for the **Consultant Augmented Generation (CAG)** era.
